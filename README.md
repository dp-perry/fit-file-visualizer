Or visit: [Fit File Analyzer](https://fit.wingusol.com/) to use the analyzer. **Does not store your .fit files** 

This open-source web app visualizes `.fit` files generated by Garmin smartwatches during running activities. It allows you to view detailed statistics, downsampled charts, and heart rate zones — just drag and drop a `.fit` file to get started.

> **_Note_**: This app only supports **.fit** files and has only been tested with running activity files recorded on smartwatches (e.g. Garmin, Coros, Suunto).
